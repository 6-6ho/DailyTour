On the very 1st day, they put the helpline to do not disturb and we couldn’t get water to drink. Everyday during my stay, i asked for the wifi as it was included in my package, but i was never able to connect and when i tried to call reception, they simply said , we are looking into it. Housekeeping will knock your door at 12 whether you’re sleeping or busy with your work, they will ring the bell and asked to clean the room. Ideally, they should have confirmed to reception or if i put my room to clean mode then they need to ping but regardless any confirmation,they’ll simply nag you all the times\n\nOverall, it’s a nice property to stay.

There is no signage for the hotel on the outside as well. The entrance location is actually on P4. It is hard to come in and out of the building cause of airport security but they do the best they can with entrance passes. It’s best to call them once you arrive so they can escort you in. I only chose this hotel because I was travelling with three seniors who are slow and thought it would be convenient to just take the elevator up to departures to leave, which it was. But I don’t think it was worth the hassle and stress of trying to find the hotel in the first place. The staff was extremely helpful and kind. Breakfast is not free."

I was grateful to the receptionist for being kind enough not to put us in the little box that was the actual “Comfort” room that was sold to me by Agoda.\nThe room had no cupboard, just one hook on the wall for three people!!\nWe ordered food in the room and our biryani and other stuff came in plastic trays with a disposable wooden spoon and fork. We didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. \nSleeping was next to impossible because our next door neighbours were creating a ruckus and the walls are so thin it felt they were in our room.\nOnly saving grace was a decent breakfast in the morning before we headed to catch our flight all groggy and tired from a terrible stay. Won’t be staying here again unless it’s a real emergency. Not recommended at all."

Earlier we had called and booked for me and my husband and one elder daughter, if all of us could stay the night in one room and they said yes. On reaching they enquired and seemed uncomfortable letting the three of us share the room for 4 hours. The reception desk staff made us wait really long, then kept checking when we will be leaving the hotel. I would not suggest this transit hotel to anyone as it is very tiring once we take one flight and come for the night to rest before our next flight and we are not even given a glass of water / place to sit, instead asked a lot of questions and before sending us to our rooms. The reception staff aren't comforting at all instead their behaviour is rude and annoying."

First - it is extremely  hard to  get a person on the phone to talk to, if you want to say something to the front desk before your arrival.  I tried  about 6 times before i could talk  (once  someone hung up after a pretense of  transferring the call, another time simple disconnect without a word).   This kind of phone attendance is  bad for  a  24  x 7  hotel.   Second issue is with the restaurant.  The breakfast buffet was okay,  but not  on par with the breakfast you will get  in a similarly priced hotel outside.  Food was clean and did not give me stomach issues (which is  a problem in india, even in some 3 star hotels outside).   But, the food is not something you will get excited about, when  eating.  Coffee was the only savior, which was like good coffee of a  4 star hotel  in india.   I spent about 10 hours in the airport, and this worked out perfectly."

        "content": "함께 여행하던 친구가 호텔 내에서 여권을 분실했습니다.\n\n체크인 이후에 방으로 이동한 후, 친구는 잠시 목욕을 했고, 저는 가족이랑 통화를 하느라 잠시 밖에 나갔다 왔고(방에서 에어텔 전파가 잡히지 않습니다) 돌아왔을 때 제 친구가 여권을 분실한 사실을 알았습니다.\n\n방을 다 뒤져도 여권을 찾을 수 없어 호텔 리셉션에 문의하고 CCTV 확인 요청을 했으나 처음에는 제 친구가 여권을 받아서 바지 주머니에 넣었다는 답변을 받았습니다.\n\n그래서 다시 다 확인해봤으나 어디에서도 여권을 찾을 수 없었고, 결국 저희는 리셉션에서 체크인 하고 방으로 이동하던 중 어디에서 인가 여권을 떨어뜨렸고, 누가 주워 가서 돌려주지 않은 게 아닐까 하는 판단을 내렸습니다.\n\n그래서 복도나 엘리베이터를 포함한 CCTV 확인을 요청했으나 복도나 엘리베이터에는 CCTV 자체가 없는 것을 알게 되었습니다.\n\n결국 저희는 경찰에 여권 분실 신고를 할거라고 호텔에 알렸더니 다음날 보안 책임자라는 남자랑 검은 양복 입은 직원 여러 명이 방에 와서는 제 짐을 포함해서 모든 짐과 방을 뒤지고, 여권을 찾지 못하고 제 친구와 함께 경찰서에 동행했습니다.\n\n경찰서의 직원들과 호텔 직원은 마치 친구처럼 반갑게 인사했고, 이후 조사 과정에서 호텔 직원은 제가 체크인 이후 호텔 밖으로 나갔다 왔으니 제가 도둑이라는 식의 발언을 경찰에게 했습니다.\n\n덕분에 밖에 있던 저는 갑자기 경찰서에 와서 조사를 받으라는 전화를 받고 달려와서 조사를 받아야 했으며, 강압적으로 소리치는 인도 경찰한태 처음 받은 질문은 \"어디 있냐? 니 친구 여권 어디 있어?\" 였습니다.\n\n저는 처음에는 여권 분실 리포트 발급을 위해서 제 진술도 필요한줄 알고 있다가 갑자기 범인 취급을 당해서 당황스러웠고, 제가 당시 호텔 밖을 나갔기 때문에 저를 범인으로 의심한다는 말을 듣고는 상당히 당황스러웠지만, 가족과 통화한 기록과 이유를 설명하고 결국 경찰서를 나올 수 있었습니다.\n\n상황상 호텔에서 저를 범인으로 의심한 게 전혀 이해가 되지 않는 것은 아니나, 제가 여권을 들고 있었다던가, 다른 사람이 저를 범인으로 지목했다던 가 하는 다른 증거 하나도 없이, 다짜고짜 제가 호텔 밖으로 나갔다는 이유만으로 고객을 도둑으로 모는 보안 담당자의 태도는 이해할 수 없습니다.\n\n오히려 저희는 호텔 측이 의심스러운데, 처음에 리셉션 직원은 체크인 이후 제 친구가 여권을 바지 주머니에 넣었다고 하면서 CCTV도 보여주지 않으려고 들다가, 경찰에게 신고하겠다고 하자 보안 담당자는 제 친구가 여권을 가방에 넣었다고 말을 바꾸고 CCTV도 확인시켜줬습니다. 이런 부분에 대한 사과는 한마디 없이 자신들은 20년 넘게 호텔에서 여권 분실이 한 번도 없었다며 저희를 이상한 사람처럼 몰고 가고, 심지어 저를 도둑인 것 처 럼 경찰에 이야기해서 난생 처음 취조도 받아보게 만들었습니다. 이는 제가 느끼기에는 보안 담당자로서 책임을 회피하기 위해 다른 손님에게 떠넘기려는 의도로밖에 느껴지지 않습니다. 수년간 알고 지내고 여러 번 여행도 함께한 제 친구의 여권을 제가 뭐 하자고 훔쳐서 밖에 나가겠습니까?\n\n또한, 나름 5성급이라는 힐튼 호텔이 복도와 엘리베이터에 CCTV 조차 없는 건 좀 이해하기 힘듭니다.\n\n이외에도 욕실 샤워 부스 청소도 안해서 샤워하다가 홍수나게 만들고, 침대 시트에는 얼룩이 남아있고 여러모로 힐튼답지 않은 부분이 많습니다. \n\n인도 호텔 컨디션이 대체로 좋지 않은 편이긴 하나 여기는 정말 추천하지 않습니다."

But beyond the lobby, our experience changed. We booked a junior suite in order to have room for our family of five. Upon entering the room, we noticed that it was not a junior suite at all, but a standard room. I asked for the manager to come up to verify. Apparently the hotel had overbooked the junior suites, and failed to mention that to us. Instead the reception staff decided not to say anything and hope we didn’t notice. The room was in very poor condition, and seemed to have not been cleaned well in quite a while. We were exhausted after a long day of traveling, so we agreed to their deal to move to a suite the next day. But when we put the kids to bed, half of the lights wouldn’t turn off! After nearly an hour of several maintenance men in our room, I had had enough. Half the room’s power was shut off, so we could at leasleep. "
